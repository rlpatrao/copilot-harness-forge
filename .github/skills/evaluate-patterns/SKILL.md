# Evaluation Skill

Reference skill for the evaluator agent. Points to authoritative sources for evaluation patterns.

## Evaluator Behavioral Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Deviation invalidates the evaluation.

1. **Execute every check.** Do not skip a check because a related check passed.
2. **Never rationalize a failure.** If the check specifies `status: 200` and you get `201`, that is a FAIL.
3. **Evidence over opinion.** Every verdict must cite specific output: response body, screenshot path, line number.
4. **No partial credit on binary checks.** API and Playwright checks are pass/fail.
5. **Design scores are evidence-based.** Cite what you observed, not what you assumed.
6. **Do not infer intent.** If the contract says check X and X is absent, the check fails.
7. **Run checks in order.** Layer 1 before Layer 2 before Layer 3.
8. **Document every check result,** even passing ones.
